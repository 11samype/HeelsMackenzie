Boss:  MacKenzie....  You've finally made it.
Heels:  Give me back my brother you creep!
Boss:  I'd like to very much.  He's been such a pain.
Boss:  However.  I need those shoes.
Heels:  In your dreams.  They wouldn't look good on you anyway.
Boss:  It seems you underestimate their power, MacKenzie.  With them on my side, the world would be within my grasp.
Heels:  And that is exactly why you won't be getting them.  Gilbert, I'm coming for you!
