High Concept Statement
Heels MacKenzie is a 2D Sidescrolling action game with an emphasis on platforming, shooting, puzzle solving, and fashion.  MacKenzie’s magical shoes and passion for high-heeled martial arts will lead her on an adventure where she will fight countless enemies, learn new fighting techniques, upgrade her shoes, and, of course, deal out high-heeled justice.

Premise
The game is set on modern day earth, with a variety of fantasy powers and creatures. The location of the game is in a little town on the east coast of the USA. MacKenzie will fight in a variety of scenarios such as her school, a forest, a haunted house, a pirate ship, underwater, a subway and eventually in the fortress containing her brother.

Story Overview
The story begins when MacKenzie finds some magically enchanted heels under a floorboard in the attic. The bullies see her wear the new heels the next day, and are aware of their limitless power, so they kidnap her nerdy brother as bait in order to steal her magical heels. Heels MacKenzie gets delayed by a multitude of enemies, who each want the heels for their own selfish reasons.
In the first level, the school’s lunch lady wants the shoes to make herself young again, and sends her lunch monsters to subdue MacKenzie and take her heels.  In the second level, local goths summon demons to attack her so they can use her shoes to gain more control of satanic powers.  In the third level, she is trapped in a haunted house, where she is attacked by ghosts as she is trying to escape.  In the fourth level, she is taken prisoner by pirates, who want the heels to help them collect treasure.  In the fifth level, she escapes the pirate ship by jumping into the sea, where she must fight off sharks and other aquatic creatures to reach land again.  In the sixth level, her search for the people who took her brother leads her to the subway where she fights heavily armed thugs in trench coats and sunglasses.  Finally, in the seventh level, she finds her way to the fortress where her brother is being held, where she fights more thugs and ultimately the final boss, who drives a large robotic battle suit.
After defeating the final boss, she and her brother return home.
